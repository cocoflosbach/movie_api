# movie_api

## Project Description

This is a REST API for an application called ‚ÄúmyFunFlix‚Äù that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. The target audience for this API are front end developers who will build interactive front end designs that utilise this API. 

It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way.
