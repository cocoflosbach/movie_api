# movie_api

## Project Description

This is a REST API for an application called “myFunFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies. The target audience for this API are front end developers who will build interactive front end designs that utilise this API. 

It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way.

## Key Features

● Return a list of ALL movies to the user
● Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a
single movie by title to the user
● Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)
● Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name
● Allow new users to register
● Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
● Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
● Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
● Allow existing users to deregister
